### About the tool
With the development of the internet, cyber-attacks are also increasing rapidly. The current cybersecurity 
is not optimistic. URL Detector is a tool built using "Machine Learning" classification algorithms.
It analyzes only the URL, without accessing the content of the websites and determines if the website is benign 
or malicious.
